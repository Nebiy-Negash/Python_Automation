Python has its own recommended code style guidelines, known as PEP 8 (Python Enhancement Proposal 8). Following a consistent code style not only makes your code more readable but also helps maintain a standard across Python projects. Here are some key points of Python code style:

1. **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces for indentation. Avoid tabs or mixing tabs and spaces.

2. **Line Length**: Keep lines below 79 characters. If necessary, you can break long lines using parentheses or the backslash ("\").

3. **Naming Conventions**: Use lowercase letters for variable and function names, and separate words with underscores (snake_case). Class names should use CamelCase (capitalizing the first letter of each word).

4. **Whitespace**: Use a single space on either side of operators and after commas. Leave a blank line between function and class definitions. Separate logical sections with blank lines to improve readability.

5. **Imports**: Import statements should be on separate lines. Group imports into three sections: standard library imports, third-party library imports, and local imports. Avoid using wildcard imports (`from module import *`) to prevent namespace pollution.

6. **Comments**: Use comments to explain your code when necessary. Place comments on a new line above the code they refer to. Keep comments concise and to the point.

7. **Docstrings**: Use docstrings to document functions, classes, and modules. Docstrings should provide a description of the object's purpose and explain its parameters, return values, and any exceptions it may raise.

8. **Function and Variable Names**: Choose descriptive names that reflect the purpose of the function or variable. Avoid using single-character names except for simple loop counters.

9. **Constants**: Use uppercase letters and underscores for constants that are not intended to be changed.

10. **Error Handling**: Handle exceptions gracefully using try-except blocks. Specify the specific exceptions to catch whenever possible, rather than using a generic except block.

These are some of the key points of Python code style. Following these guidelines enhances the readability, maintainability, and consistency of your code. It is also worth noting that tools like linters (e.g., pylint, flake8) can automatically check your code for adherence to the PEP 8 guidelines and help you identify potential issues.
