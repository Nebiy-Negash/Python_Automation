```
print("Hello, World!")

```
**Print** is a Python function that writes what we tell it to on the screen. The print function is part of the basic python language, whenever we use keywords or functions that are part of the language, we're using the programming language's syntax to tell the computer what to do. 

**Functions and Keywords**

**Functions** are pieces of code that perform a unit of work. **Keywords** are reserved words that are used to construct instructions. These words are the core part of the language and can only be used in a specific ways. some examples include:

Python has a set of reserved words called "keywords" that have specific meanings and purposes within the language. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.) because they are already defined and have predefined functionalities. Here is a list of Python keywords:

- **and**: A logical operator used to combine conditions. It returns True if both conditions are True.
- **as**: Used in the context of the "with" statement to assign a target name to a context manager.
- **assert**: Used for debugging purposes to check if a condition is True. If the condition is False, it raises an AssertionError.
- **break**: Used to exit from a loop prematurely.
- **class**: Used to define a class, which is a blueprint for creating objects.
- **continue**: Used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration.
- **def**: Used to define a function.
- **del**: Used to delete a reference to an object.
- **elif**: Short for "else if," it is used in conditional statements to check additional conditions.
- **else**: Used in conditional statements to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is False.
- **except**: Used in exception handling to catch and handle specific exceptions.
- **finally**: Used in exception handling to specify a block of code that will be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.
- **for**: Used to create a loop that iterates over a sequence.
- **from**: Used to import specific attributes or functions from a module.
- **global**: Used to indicate that a variable is a global variable, accessible throughout the program.
- **if**: Used to define a conditional statement.
- **import**: Used to import a module into the current program.
- **in**: Used as a membership operator to check if a value is present in a sequence.
- **is**: Used to check if two objects are the same object, not just equal in value.
- **lambda**: Used to create anonymous functions.
- **nonlocal**: Used to indicate that a variable refers to a variable in the nearest enclosing scope, excluding the global scope.
- **not**: A logical operator used to negate a condition.
- **or**: A logical operator used to combine conditions. It returns True if at least one condition is True.
- **pass**: Used as a placeholder when no action is required.
- **raise**: Used to raise an exception explicitly.
- **return**: Used to exit a function and return a value.
- **try**: Used for exception handling to enclose code that might raise an exception.
- **while**: Used to create a loop that executes as long as a condition is True.
- **with**: Used to simplify the management of resources by establishing a context for the execution of a block of code.
- **yield**: Used in generator functions to return a value without terminating the function, allowing it to be resumed later.

These keywords are an integral part of the Python language and have specific meanings and functionalities.
